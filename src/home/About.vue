        I am a life-long lover of music. Over the past 10+ years I've worked on
        video games, videos, advertisements, ensemble pieces, and a variety of
        other collaborations, serving as composer, producer, arranger, musician,
        and more. My first goal in any musical project is to create the most
        impactful work possible; to replicate the profound way that so many
        great works of music have affected me. I also write software!
