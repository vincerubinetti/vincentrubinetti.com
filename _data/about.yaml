Over the last 10+ years he has worked on video games, videos, advertisements, ensemble pieces, and a variety of other collaborations, serving as composer, producer, arranger, musician, and more. His first goal in any musical project is to create the most impactful work possible; to affect people in the same profound way that so many great works of music have affected him.
